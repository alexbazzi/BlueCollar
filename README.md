# Rizzler
A simple compiler written in Python for a brainrot-zoomer-like language, taken from Austin Henley's <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html">Teeny Tiny Compiler project</a>. The output is C code, which needs to be further compiled into machine code (I know...).

Check out the  [example](example/) directory for a (bitter) taste of the language.

## TODO list
 - Replace all keywords with brainrot Ohio gyatt rizz
 - Add code formatting for C output
 - Automate compilation with bash script (all my homies hate cross-platform)
 - Add an AST for intermediate representation and optimizations
